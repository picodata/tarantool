/**
 * The tuple cache is an ordered tree of cache entries. An entry
 * holds one statement. It is either an INSERT or REPLACE
 * previously returned to a reader, or a DELETE, or a bound key
 * -- an infimum or supremum bound of the tuples matching a key
 * (VY_STMT_INFIMUM/VY_STMT_SUPREMUM). A DELETE entry states
 * that the key's latest version is a deletion, while mems or
 * runs may hold older versions visible to some older read view:
 * the cache stores a single, latest version of data plus the
 * fact that older versions exist elsewhere. Only INSERTs and
 * REPLACEs are ever returned to readers. During a scan, when
 * the cache iterator encounters a DELETE, it checks the read
 * view LSN against the DELETE LSN: a read view with a newer
 * LSN skips the DELETE entry and proceeds to the next tuple; a
 * read view with an older LSN must descend to mems or runs for
 * the matching version of tuples.
 *
 * The cache is a mirror of the committed data. Prepared, but not
 * committed data is never admitted, and this is correct because
 * cache invalidation happens already at txn prepare: from that
 * moment until a reader re-populates the entry, the cache has a
 * gap where the write landed, never a stale entry. A gap sends
 * the reader to the deeper sources, which do serve prepared data
 * to the readers that may see it.
 *
 * Each index, primary or secondary, has a cache of its own,
 * storing full tuples. The tuples are referenced, so most of
 * the time a secondary index cache shares the tuple object with
 * the primary. Each cache entry has an own heat, and the shared
 * tuple has a heat of its own -- the row's temperature: a read
 * through any index heats both. A secondary cache evicts an
 * entry by the entry's own heat: when a row stops being read
 * through that index, its entry leaves that cache, even while
 * the row stays hot in the others. The primary index is the
 * row's home and follows the shared heat, which the primary
 * eviction hand alone cools: the row outlives its use through
 * any index, not just the primary's. The cooling is weighted by
 * the row's size: at equal heat a smaller row lives longer --
 * the quota is bytes, and evicting one large row frees room for
 * many small ones. A secondary cache admits a
 * tuple only while the row is resident in the primary cache --
 * the primary entry is the write path's rendezvous with the row
 * -- and a secondary entry whose row leaves it, or is
 * overwritten, is maybe stale: invisible to every reader,
 * collected on encounter. A tuple that is not maybe stale is
 * therefore the newest committed version of its row, and a
 * secondary read serves it as is; any other secondary result
 * is resolved against the primary in
 * vy_get_by_secondary_tuple().
 *
 * Two adjacent entries can be connected with a link, meaning no
 * tuples exist between them. A fully cached scan is a chain of
 * linked entries bounded by keys. For example, an EQ scan of key
 * {10} in a non-unique index holding tuples {10, 1} and {10, 2}
 * leaves the footprint
 *
 *   [10]- -> {10, 1} -> {10, 2} -> [10]+
 *
 * where [10]- and [10]+ are the infimum and supremum keys of 10
 * and each arrow is a link. The bound keys complete the chain at
 * both ends: the infimum proves no match precedes {10, 1}, the
 * supremum proves none follows {10, 2}, so a repeated scan is
 * served without leaving the cache.
 *
 * A DELETE does not always become an entry of its own. When the
 * chain being built already ends with a bound key or a DELETE,
 * a newly read DELETE is fused into that entry: no new entry is
 * created, and the existing entry's LSN is raised to the fused
 * DELETE's LSN, remembering the newest of them. E.g. a full
 * scan of a table holding tuples {1} and {5} and DELETEs 2, 3,
 * and 4 leaves the following trace in the cache:
 *
 *   {1} -> D{2} -> {5}
 *
 * with a single DELETE entry carrying the LSN of delete{4}; a
 * GE{2} scan over the same table records all three deletes on
 * its own start bound instead, [2]- at that LSN, and no DELETE
 * entry appears at all. The same happens on insertion: a DELETE
 * that would land right next to a bound key or a DELETE left by
 * another scan is fused into it. The one LSN serves every fused
 * key. A reader at or above it sees the entry and follows its
 * links: each fused key is simply absent. A reader below it
 * does not see the entry and does not follow its links; it
 * descends to the deeper sources, where each DELETE still
 * lives at its own LSN.
 *
 * A pending link is a link under construction: opened before the
 * reader yields, completed when the reader produces the entry on
 * the other side, destroyed by any write between the two entries.
 * Each read iterator has an own unique id it uses to mark
 * its pending links. An entry holds at most one pending link. If
 * two read iterators try to extend a link from the same entry
 * concurrently, the one who came last wins.
 *
 * Glossary:
 *
 * - entry: an element of the cache tree -- a statement plus one
 *   word of link state.
 * - bound key: an entry holding a key marked VY_STMT_INFIMUM or
 *   VY_STMT_SUPREMUM; carries links, never returned to readers.
 * - chain: the linked entries of one scan, ended by bound keys.
 * - start bound, end bound: the bound keys a scan inserts at
 *   the two ends of its chain.
 * - pending link: a link under construction: opened before the
 *   reader yields, completed by the next result, aborted by a
 *   write into its range or by eviction of a neighbor.
 * - scan id: the unique id of one range scan, stamped on the
 *   pending links it opens and checked at their completion.
 * - frontier: the chain's last added point.
 * - hop: the cache iterator's advance to the next visible
 *   tuple, over bound keys and consumed DELETEs.
 * - heat: the GCLOCK use counter; a use raises it, the eviction
 *   hand cools it, zero means evict. Meta entries and secondary
 *   tuple entries go by their entry's own heat; a primary tuple
 *   entry goes by the shared statement heat, cooled by the
 *   row's size in units of the resident mean -- see
 *   VY_STMT_HEAT_MASK -- and leaves its entry heat untouched.
 * - maybe stale: a secondary tuple entry whose statement may
 *   not be the row's latest: it is no longer cached in the
 *   primary, where a write would find -- and retire -- it;
 *   invisible to every reader, collected on encounter by a
 *   point lookup or the eviction hand.
 * - to fuse: to absorb a DELETE or a bound key into an adjacent
 *   entry, raising that entry's LSN, instead of keeping two
 *   entries; eviction likewise fuses two links into one over a
 *   removed entry.
 * - guarded: carrying a DELETE LSN above the oldest read view:
 *   some reader may still see a deleted key alive under it.
 * - to land, to cross: a seek lands on an entry; the walk then
 *   crosses the gaps between entries. A bound key landed on or
 *   stopped at earns heat; one merely crossed does not.

 * Record a consumed DELETE in the chain. DELETEs are tracked
 * during scans to correctly serve scans on behalf of non-latest
 * read views: such a scan may still see the deleted tuple alive
 * and must ignore the recorded DELETE and descend to mems or
 * runs for the original tuple. Cache invalidation is not the
 * point here: it happens in vy_cache_on_write(), which either
 * directly removes the deleted tuple or clears its PK_CACHED
 * flag, so that it is removed later.
 *
 * The nuances, case by case. A DELETE at or below the read view
 * horizon serves no reader that can ever exist: it is not
 * recorded, and the chain is not broken either -- the neighbors
 * link up across the dead key. A DELETE fuses into
 * the previous chain entry when that entry is a DELETE or a
 * bound key: its LSN rises instead of a second entry entering
 * the cache, so consecutive dead keys cost one entry however
 * many there are -- or none, when a scan's own start bound
 * absorbs them.
 *
 * A below-horizon refusal also drops the stale cached row, if
 * any, because nothing else ever will. E.g. a secondary index
 * caches tuple {1, 10}; the primary row is then deleted with
 * the secondary DELETE deferred, so this cache is not
 * invalidated and still holds {1, 10}; a later scan resolves
 * the key through the primary index and finds it dead. When no
 * reader is old enough to see the row, the DELETE itself is
 * not worth recording, but the stale {1, 10} must be dropped
 * right here: no write ever lands on this key in this index
 * again.
 *
 * The key may also be proven dead by a prepared but not
 * committed transaction: a reader that sees prepared data can
 * resolve a secondary tuple through the primary index and find
 * the row overwritten by a transaction that has not committed
 * yet. Such a death can still be undone: if that transaction
 * rolls back, the key is alive again, and the rollback does not
 * invalidate this cache -- the secondary DELETE is deferred and
 * was never written anywhere. So the DELETE is not recorded,
 * and the chain breaks: a link over the key would claim it
 * absent while it may come back.
 *
 * @param builder the reader's chain.
 * @param delete_key the dead key statement.
 * @param delete_lsn the LSN of the statement that deleted the
 * key, 0 if unknown.

/**

 * 1) open the chain's pending link at the entry, before the

 *    completes a link back to it -- the chain-formation step;
 * 2) advance the frontier (vy_cache_builder::last): besides
 *    anchoring the link above, it lets vy_cache_builder_add()
 *    recognize a result served from the cache by comparing
 *    against it, sparing the re-insertion -- no tree operation
 *    on a re-scan;
 * 3) remember the entry's tree position
 *    (vy_cache_builder::last_pos): a reader restoring after a
 *    cache change hops from the revalidated frontier instead
 *    of descending the tree, see vy_cache_iterator_restore();
