/**
 * A struct for primary and secondary Vinyl indexes.
 * Named after the data structure used for organizing
 * data on disk - log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree).
 *
 * Vinyl primary and secondary indexes work differently:
 *
 * - the primary index is fully covering (also known as
 *   "clustered" in MS SQL circles).
 *   It stores all tuple fields of the tuple coming from
 *   INSERT/REPLACE/UPDATE/DELETE operations. This index is
 *   the only place where the full tuple is stored.
 *
 * - a secondary index only stores parts participating in the
 *   secondary key, coalesced with parts of the primary key.
 *   Duplicate parts, i.e. identical parts of the primary and
 *   secondary key are only stored once. (@sa key_def_merge
 *   function). This reduces the disk and RAM space necessary to
 *   maintain a secondary index, but adds an extra look-up in the
 *   primary key for every fetched tuple.
 *
 * When a search in a secondary index is made, we first look up
 * the secondary index tuple, containing the primary key, and then
 * use this key to find the original tuple in the primary index.
 *
 * While the primary index has only one key_def that is
 * used for validating and comparing tuples, secondary index needs
 * two:
 *
 * - the first one is defined by the user. It contains the key
 *   parts of the secondary key, as present in the original tuple.
 *   This is key_def.
 *
 * - the second one is used to fetch key parts of the secondary
 *   key, *augmented* with the parts of the primary key from the
 *   original tuple and compare secondary index tuples. These
 *   parts concatenated together construe the tuple of the
 *   secondary key, i.e. the tuple stored. This is key_def.

	 *    with id = 0 (uncommitted) from the worker's training

	 *
	 *  - Recovery: vy_lsm_recover() creates dicts from raw data
	 *    stored in vylog, with their permanent id already set.
	 *
	 * A dict with id = 0 is committed on the next dump or
	 * compaction by vy_run_prepare(), which assigns
	 * dict->id = run->id (the id of the first run that uses it)
	 * and inserts it into this hash via vy_lsm_add_dict().
	 *

	 * dict_last (the active dict for the LSM tree) and by each
	 * vy_run compressed with it. When vy_lsm_add_dict()
	 * registers a dict, it sets an on_drop callback
	 * (vy_dict_on_drop) with vy_lsm as context. When the last
	 * reference is dropped via vy_dict_unref(), the callback
	 * removes the dict from this hash, updates stats, and frees
	 * the dict. Dicts never registered (id = 0) have no callback
	 * and are freed directly by vy_dict_delete().
	 *
	 * Lifecycle (vylog):
	 *
	 * Each run records the dict_id it was compressed with
	 * (0 if none). The originating run (whose id == dict_id)
	 * carries the raw dictionary bytes in its PREPARE_RUN
	 * record. Other runs sharing the same dict only store the
	 * dict_id reference.
	 *
	 * Dictionaries are first-class objects in the vylog,
	 * stored via VY_LOG_CREATE_DICT records. During vylog
	 * rotation, dicts are emitted before runs so that the
	 * dictionary bytes appear in the log before any
	 * referencing run.
	 *
	 * During recovery, dict data and a reference count
	 * (dict_refs) are tracked in vy_dict_recovery_info,
	 * stored per-LSM in an rb-tree keyed by dict id.
	 * When a run is forgotten (FORGET_RUN), dict_refs on
	 * the corresponding dict are decremented. A dict with
